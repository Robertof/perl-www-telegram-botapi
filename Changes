  - Happy Halloween!
  - Add new debugging mode, enabled by setting the `TELEGRAM_BOTAPI_DEBUG` environment variable
    to a true value.
  - `api_request` now dies when, in the response, `ok` is missing or set to a false value.
    This means that `undef` can no longer be returned.
    Consequently, error messages returned from Telegram - when available - are now shown when
    dying (instead of showing just the HTTP response code).
  - Several improvements to the documentation and the code.
