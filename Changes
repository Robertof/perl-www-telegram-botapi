  - Major change to how requests are handled. Every request is now sent using `application/json`
    by default, except when uploading, where `multipart/form-data` is used instead.
    This has the benefit of allowing the usage of complex objects with zero effort.
    It *should not* be a breaking change (except if dealing with the internals of this module).
  - Implement `parse_error`. This new method allows to parse errors and obtain information about
    them, such as their source or code. Please see the updated documentation.
  - Asynchronous callbacks are no more mandatory when async mode is enabled. When the callback is
    missing, requests are simply executed synchronously.

  - Happy Halloween!
  - Add new debugging mode, enabled by setting the `TELEGRAM_BOTAPI_DEBUG` environment variable
    to a true value.
  - `api_request` now dies when, in the response, `ok` is missing or set to a false value.
    This means that `undef` can no longer be returned.
    Consequently, error messages returned from Telegram - when available - are now shown when
    dying (instead of showing just the HTTP response code).
  - Several improvements to the documentation and the code.

  - DESTROY is not handled by AUTOLOAD anymore.
  - Now using `Carp::confess` instead of `die` for server-side errors.
  - The documentation now has more examples.

  - First release.
